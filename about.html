      <p>Well-being, wellbeing, or wellness is a general term for the condition of an individual or group. A high level
        of well-being means in some sense the individual or group's condition is positive.</p>
      <p>Wellness refers to diverse and interconnected dimensions of physical, mental, and social
        well-being that extend beyond the traditional definition of health. It includes choices and activities aimed at
        achieving physical vitality, mental alacrity, social satisfaction, a sense of accomplishment, and personal
        fulfillment</p></div>

      <h3 class="mb-4">Expert speakers</h3>
      <p>There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in Lasswell's model of communication: the
        communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "who
        says what in which channel to whom with what effect?"</p>
      <p>Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or
        some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a discourse community, in which the
        audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.</p>
